# SOC Analyst Project | Threat Detection, Simulation, Automation & SIEM Integration .

This project demonstrates a **comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC)** setup designed to enable **real-time threat detection**, automated responses, and seamless **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** integration. The project includes **Sigma detection rules**, attack simulations, and a variety of tools for automating security workflows, providing hands-on experience with industry-standard SOC practices.

---

## Project Overview

The **SOC Analyst Project** integrates multiple components to monitor, detect, and respond to various security incidents. Key features include:

- **Sigma Detection Rules**: Detection of attacks such as **Brute Force**, **Process Injection**, and **Suspicious DNS Queries** using Sigma format.
- **Attack Simulations**: Realistic simulations of common attack scenarios that help test the detection capabilities.
- **Automated Response**: Scripts that automatically block malicious IPs or take other predefined actions when an attack is detected.
- **SIEM Integration**: Configuration and use of **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Kibana) to collect, analyze, and visualize data in real time.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full documentation explaining the project structure, setup, and execution.

## Features

- **Sigma Detection Rules**  
  - Detect Brute Force login attempts, Process Injection, Suspicious DNS Queries, and more.
  - Built in the Sigma YAML format, easily adaptable to various SIEM systems.

- **Attack Simulations**  
  - Simulate **Brute Force Attacks**, **Process Injection**, and **Data Exfiltration** to test detection systems.
  - Scripts include both **PowerShell** and **Bash** variations for cross-platform testing.

- **Automated Response**  
  - Implement automation scripts for blocking malicious IP addresses or triggering alerts upon attack detection.

## SIEM Integration

This project uses the **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging and threat detection.

- Logs generated from simulated attacks are forwarded to **Elasticsearch** via configured pipelines.
- **Kibana dashboards are manually built** from these logs after the attack simulations.
- These dashboards help in visualizing attack patterns, detection alerts, and overall security posture.
- ⚠️ **Note**: Dashboards are not pre-exported in this repository. Users are encouraged to manually create visualizations from the logged events to gain practical experience.

- **Reporting & Documentation**  
  - Complete project documentation, including installation instructions, setup guides, and a detailed report on attack simulations and testing results.

---
### Prerequisites

- **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for SIEM functionality.
- **PowerShell** for running attack simulations on Windows.
- **Bash** for attack simulations on Linux/macOS.

## Testing & Results

### Simulated Attacks:

* **Brute Force**: Triggered using Hydra. Detected by `brute_force.yml`.
* **Process Injection**: Injected using PowerShell. Detected by `process_injection.yml`.
* **DNS Abuse**: Queried suspicious domain. Detected by `suspicious_dns_queries.yml`.

### Response Automation:

* **IP Blocking**: Malicious IPs blocked using custom automation scripts.
* **Alerting**: Real-time alerts sent and visualized in Kibana.
