# SOC Analyst Project - Complete Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to simulate a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) environment that replicates real-world threat detection, investigation, and response scenarios. With the growing demand for skilled SOC analysts in the cybersecurity industry, this project serves as a comprehensive, hands-on experience that provides learners with a chance to:

* Understand the behavior of real-world attacks
* Develop custom detection rules
* Monitor and visualize security events
* Build automated defensive mechanisms

This project is not just theoretical — it combines industry-standard tools, detection frameworks, and actual attack simulations to mimic the daily activities of blue teams in organizations.

## 2. Why This Project Was Created

### Motivation

1. **Bridging the Knowledge Gap**: Traditional cybersecurity education often lacks real-world simulation. This project fills that gap.
2. **Career Preparation**: SOC Analyst is a critical role. This project trains you in log analysis, threat detection, and rule creation — all job-relevant skills.
3. **Showcase Portfolio**: This project serves as a resume-boosting, GitHub-worthy proof of hands-on expertise.
4. **Hackathon/Workshop**: Highly modular and extensible for hackathons and workshops.

### What Makes It Unique

* It doesn’t rely solely on pre-existing tools or dashboards — you build your own detection stack.
* Simulates attacks using tools like `hydra` and PowerShell.
* Includes custom Sigma rules for detection.
* Uses open-source ELK (Elastic Stack) for log ingestion and visualization.
* Automates response actions using bash scripts.

## 5. Components Explained (Basic to Advanced)

### 5.1 Sigma Detection Rules (Basic → Advanced)

**Basics:** Sigma is a generic and vendor-agnostic rule format for SIEM systems. It allows you to describe what kind of logs should be flagged as suspicious.

**Advanced Usage:** You can write Sigma rules based on:

* Windows Event IDs (e.g., 4625 for failed login)
* Process relationships (e.g., cmd.exe spawning PowerShell)
* DNS logs (e.g., connections to known malicious domains)

**Example Rule:**

```yaml
logsource:
  product: windows
  service: security
  definition: 'Brute Force Attack Detection'
  level: high

detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 4625
    AccountName: user123
  condition: selection
```

### 5.2 Attack Simulations (Red Team Mindset)

**Brute Force Attack**: Simulated using `hydra`, targets SSH or RDP with dictionary-based credentials. Helps test if SIEM can detect repeated failed logins.

**Process Injection**: Simulated using PowerShell scripts. A child process (e.g., `rundll32.exe`) is spawned by an unusual parent (`powershell.exe`).

**DNS Exfiltration**: Uses fake domain names like `badexample.xyz` to simulate data exfiltration over DNS.

**Purpose**: These simulations generate log events that can be detected by the SIEM stack.

### 5.3 SIEM Integration (Elastic Stack)

**Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes logs.

**Logstash**: Parses logs using filters and pushes to Elasticsearch.

**Kibana**: Creates dashboards and visualizations from data.

**Pipeline Flow:**

```
Log File → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana Dashboard
```

**Dashboards Built:**

* Login Failures by Host
* Suspicious DNS Queries by Time
* Parent-Child Process Tree (PowerShell → rundll32)

### 5.4 Automation Scripts

**block\_ip.sh**: Automatically blocks IPs that trigger certain alerts.

**Logic:**

* Monitors logs for specific event patterns
* Extracts source IP
* Updates firewall rules

**Can be extended to:**

* Email alerts
* SOAR tools integration
* SIEM alert ingestion
